# Textual Analysis of Robert Frost's poems.

This is a pet project: I am brushing up on my R and Python skills using the poetry of Robert Frost (RF). 

The current agenda:

1) Collect RF's poems into .txt files using Python through scraping poemhunter.com. Collect metatadata from other sources.

2) Organize and clean the files. Perform some preliminary textual analysis on the poems using Python, Stata, and R each. 

3) See where to go from there.
